# Objective

An open-source Dashboard to enable quick monitoring of student progress. The primary users are administrators who manage large non-academic courses. The Dashboard provides the users the following insights:
* The progress of the students at course level
* Each course is comprised of multiple modules. Which module are most students on. Can it help answer the question, should the course be designed in a linear and sequential fashion.
* Completion percentage of a module amongst all students enrolled in the course.
* Completion percentage of a student across different modules in the course.
* Completion percentage of a student across different items in a module.
* Completion percentage of an item amongst all students in a module.

The modules and items should be displayed in the visualizations in the same order as on Canvas. The information can be communicated through both visualizations and generated report.

## Data-Source
Canvas API through module progress.
(OR)
Develop a javascript for Tampermonkey to extract data through the Canvas API.

## Documentation
Capture learnings, detailed documentation on development cycle.

## Usage
